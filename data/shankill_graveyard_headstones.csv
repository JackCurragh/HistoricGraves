Hither he invited the needy by his charity, and the meek by his persuasion and by his example.   Nor was anything wanting in conjugal affection and paternal love, of all he was perhaps first and second to none.  Stranger remark! That whatever he may now be, it is easy to initiate his virtue, so that the gate may be found open to you.”“This vault was renovated in the year 1959 by the Right Honourable WILLIAM GEORGE EDWARD, FOURTH BARON LURGAN, in grateful memory of his dear aunt the HONOURABLE ANNETTE BROWNLOW, youngest daughter of CHARLES SECOND BARON LURGAN, Born March 1874, Died August 1967.”                                  "
